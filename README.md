# papyrus.gui
A graphical user interface for papyrus, made for those who fear the terminal.

## Introduction
Since papyrus is a command line tool, some end-users just don't want to fiddle with the terminal and seek a straight forward solution for rendering their Minecraft: Bedrock Edition worlds.

The graphical user interface is as easy as it gets. Choose an input path for your world, an output path where you want your rendered map to be created and press "Render!". That's all there is to it!

## Installation
